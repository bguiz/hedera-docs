# Ħello World, Ħello Future

❓ So you want to develop on [Hedera](https://hedera.com/).

🤷 Not sure where to start?

🕙 Why not start with something you could complete in 10 minutes?

🏁 Let's go! 🎉🎉🎉

## Hello World Sequences

<!--
There are multiple Hello World sequences for you to follow along.

To start, you **must** do the first sequence,
as you will need a **funded account** to do any other tasks on Hedera.
Subsequently, you can do the remaining sequences in any order.
-->

- [Create and fund an account](./create-fund-account/)
<!-- TODO
- [HFS: Files with SDK](./hfs-files-sdk/)
- [HSCS: Smart contract with SDK](./hscs-smart-contract-sdk/)
- [HSCS: Smart contract with EthersJs](./hscs-smart-contract-ethersjs/)
- [HTS: Fungible token with SDK](./hts-ft-sdk/)
- [HTS: Non-fungible token with SDK](./hts-nft-sdk/)
-->
