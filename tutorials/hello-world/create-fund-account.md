  Hello World sequence:
  Create a new account on Hedera Testnet, and fund it.
  Do this before any of the other Hello World sequences.

# Create and fund an account

## What you will accomplish

- âœ… Create an account on Hedera Testnet
- âœ… Fund this new account with tHBAR

The repo, [`github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/),
is intended to be used alongside this tutorial.

***

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you should be familiar with the following:

- âœ… Javascript syntax

Also, you should have the following set up on your computer:

- âœ… `git` installed
	- Minimum version: 2.37
	- [Install Git (Github)](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git)
- âœ… NodeJs + `npm` installed
	- Minimum version of NodeJs: 18
	- Minimum version of `npm`: 9.5
	- Recommended for Linux & Mac: [`nvm`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)
	- Recommended for Windows: [`nvm-windows`](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
- âœ… POSIX-compliant shell
	- For Linux & Mac: The shell that ships with the operating system will work. Either `bash` or `zsh` will work.
	- For Windows: The shell that ships with the operating system (`cmd.exe`, `powershell.exe`) will *not* work. Recommended alternatives: WSL/2, or git-bash which ships with git-for-windows.

***

## Steps

### Set up project

To follow along, start with the `main` branch,
which is the *default branch* of this repo.
This gives you the initial state from which you can follow along
with the steps as described in the tutorial.

```shell
git clone git@github.com:hedera-dev/hello-future-world.git
```

In the terminal, make a `.env` file by copying the provided `.env.sample` file.
Then open that file in a code editor, such as VS code (`code`).

```shell
cd 00-create-fund-account/
cp .env.sample .env
code .env
```

### Create account

If you already have an account on the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com),
you may skip the following steps.

<details>

<summary>Set up a Hedera Portal account</summary>

Visit the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com),
and create a Testnet account.

[![localhost-init-step-03][5]][5]

Copy-paste the confirmation code sent to your email.

[![localhost-init-step-04][6]][6]

Fill out this form.

[![localhost-init-step-05][7]][7]

In the top-left select Hedera Testnet from the drop-down.

[![localhost-init-step-07][8]][8]

</details>

The main screen of the [Hedera Portal](https://portal.hedera.com),
should show you your accounts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that there are 2 separate accounts on this page.

- (1) Account Ed25519
- (2) Account ECDSA

To follow along, use **Account ECDSA**.
{% endhint %}

Copy the value of "HEX Encoded Private Key",
and replace `ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY` in the `.env` file with it.

[![localhost-init-step-08][10]][10]

From the same screen, copy the value of "Account ID",
and replace `ACCOUNT_ID` in the `.env` file with it.

For example, if your Account ID is `0.0.123`,
and your DER encoded private key is `0xabcd1234`,
the 2 lines in your `.env` file should look like this:

```text
ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.123
ACCOUNT_PRIVATE_KEY=0xabcd1234
```

ðŸŽ‰ Now you are ready to start using your Hedera Testnet account
from the portal within script files on your computer! ðŸŽ‰

***

### Write the script

An almost-complete script has already been prepared for you,
and you will only need to make a few modifications (outlined below)
for it to run successfully.

First, install the dependencies using `npm`.

```shell
npm install
```

Then open the script file, `script-create-fund-account.js`, in a code editor.

#### Step 1: Initialise account using `Client`

Initialise the `client` instance by invoking the `setOperator` method,
and passing in `accountId` and `accountKey` as parameter.

```javascript
    const client = Client.forTestnet().setOperator(accountId, accountKey);
```

Now the `client` instance represents and operates your account.

#### Step 2: Obtain the balance of the account

Use the `AccountBalanceQuery` method to obtain the tHBAR balance of your account.

```javascript
    const accountBalance = await new AccountBalanceQuery()
```

Note that the return value is an object, and needs to be parsed.

#### Step 3: Convert balance result object to Hbars

Parse that return value to extract its tHBAR balance,
so that you may convert into a string for display purposes.

```javascript
    const accountBalanceHbars = accountBalance.hbars.toBigNumber();
```

### Run the script

Run the script using the following command:

```shell
node script-create-fund-account.js
```

You should see output similar to the following:

```text
accountId: 0.0.1186
accountBalanceTinybars: 10,000.00000000
accountExplorerUrl: https://hashscan.io/testnet/account/0.0.1186
```

Open the URL, that was output as `accountExplorerUrl` above,
in your browser and check that:

- (1) The accounts exists.
- (2) The balance matches.

***

## Complete

Congratulations, you have completed this Hello World sequence! ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰

***

### Next Steps

Now that you have an account on Hedera Testnet, and it is funded,
you will be able to interact with the Hedera network.
Continue by following along with
[the other Hello World sequences](../).

***

## Cheat sheet

To skip ahead to the final state, use the `completed` branch.
This gives you the final state with which you can compare
your implementation to the completed steps of the tutorial.

```shell
git fetch origin completed:completed
git checkout completed
```

To see the full set of differences between
the initial and final states of the repo,
you can use `diff`.

```shell
cd 00-create-fund-account/
git diff main..completed -- ./
```

Alternatively, you may view the `diff` rendered on Github:
[`hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed`](https://github.com/hedera-dev/hello-future-world/compare/main..completed)
(This will show the `diff` for *all* sequences.)

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that the branch names are delimited by `..`, and not by `...`,
as the latter finds the `diff` with the latest common ancestor commit,
which *is not* what we want in this case.
{% endhint %}
